# TruthLayer - A Platform for Content Credibility

**Tagline:** Bringing a layer of trust to the web by verifying the credibility of online content through AI and crowd-sourced validation.

## The Problem
In the digital age, misinformation spreads rapidly across social media platforms and news outlets. It is increasingly difficult for users to distinguish between credible information and deliberate falsehoods, leading to polarization and mistrust.

## The Solution
TruthLayer is a full-stack web platform and browser extension that provides real-time "trust signals" on web content. By combining AI-powered analysis with a robust system of crowd-sourced verification, it helps users make informed judgments about the articles, tweets, and reviews they consume.

## Core Features (Planned for MVP)
- **Browser Extension:** Overlays trust scores and verification summaries directly on social media posts and articles.
- **AI Analysis:** Initial automated assessment of content based on source reputation, linguistic patterns, and logical fallacies.
- **Crowd Verification:** Allows users to submit content for review and contribute to the verification process.
- **User Reputation System:** Builds a community of trusted verifiers.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express 
* **Database (Planned):** MongoDB / PostgreSQL
* **APIs (Planned):** Web APIs for the browser extension, potential integration with NLP models.

## Project Status
**Phase: Architectural Planning & Initial Development**
This repository contains the initial project structure and boilerplate for the TruthLayer platform. The core concepts and feature set have been defined, and development of the MVP is underway.

## Future Goals
- Develop the core browser extension functionality.
- Build out the user authentication and verification submission backend.
- Begin training or integrating a preliminary AI model for content analysis.
